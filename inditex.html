<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<p>The Origin of Vitronia

Centuries ago, when ancient nations were collapsing under the weight of pollution and disease, a group of scientists, physicians, and philosophers decided to create a haven where life and technology could coexist in harmony.
Guided by Dr. Lunara Vey, they built a city on a peninsula surrounded by crystal mountains and luminous seas. They named this new land Vitronia, from the ancient term "Vitra," meaning pure life.

Over time, science became their moral compass. The citizens learned that progress without compassion leads to illness, and health without knowledge fades. Thus, their motto was born:

"For light and life."

Since then, Vitronia has grown into a beacon of balance, where every innovation seeks to care for both humanity and the planet that sustains it.</p>

<h2>Official Language:</h2><h3>Vitronese was born from the fusion of ancient languages (Latin, Esperanto, and some technical Japanese) with technological neologisms.</h3>
<h2>Official Currency:</h2><p>Name: Vitra (from the Vitronese word "Vitra," which means "vital energy" or "life in balance").</p>
 <p>ymbol: Ʌ (a letter that represents the "V" for life and the ascending flow of energy).</p> 
 <p>Monetary System
Main Unit: 1 Ʌ (one Vitra)

Subunits:

1 Ʌ = 100 Lumis (from the Vitronese word "Lumira," meaning "light").

Most Common Denominations:

Coins: 1 Ʌ, 2 Ʌ, 5 Ʌ, 10 Ʌ
Smart Banknotes: 20 Ʌ, 50 Ʌ, 100 Ʌ, 200 Ʌ, 500 Ʌ</p>  
<h2>National Symbols:</h2><h2>BANDERA</h2><h3>Balance between nature and technology.</h3> <p>Sky blue at the top, representing the energy of the sky and the purity of knowledge. Bright white in the center, a symbol of light and clean technology. Emerald green at the bottom, reflecting the connection with nature.</p>
<h2>ESCUDO</h2><h3>It shows a central crystal surrounded by branches of the bioluminescent tree of Virelia. Behind the crystal, a quill (wisdom) and an energy bolt (technology) cross each other.</h3>
<h2>LEMA</h2><p>In summary, the Vitronian philosophy seeks to achieve "Light" (Lumira) and "Life in Balance" (Vitra) by maintaining a relationship of mutual respect and dependence between technological innovation and the natural ecosystem.</p><h3>LUZ Y VIDA</h3>
